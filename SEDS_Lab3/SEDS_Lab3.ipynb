    "#### About Classes and Objects\n",
    "Classes are a way of combining information and behavior. For example, let's consider what you'd need to do if you were creating a rocket ship in a game, or in a physics simulation. One of the first things you'd want to track are the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the rocket. Here is what a simple rocket ship class looks like in code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Rocket():\n",
    "    # Rocket simulates a rocket ship for a game,\n",
    "    #  or a physics simulation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        # Each rocket has an (x,y) position.\n",
    "        self.x = 0\n",
    "        self.y = 0\n",
    "        \n",
    "    def move_up(self, x_increment=0, y_increment=1):\n",
    "        # Move the rocket according to the paremeters given.\n",
    "        #  Default behavior is to move the rocket up one unit.\n",
    "        self.x += x_increment\n",
    "        self.y += y_increment\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__init__()` method in the Rocket Class is a special function calles constructor that lets you make sure that all relevant attributes are set to their proper values when an object is created from the class, before the object is used. In this case, The `__init__()` method initializes the $x$ and $y$ values of the Rocket to 0.\n",
    "The Rocket class stores two pieces of information and has a core behavior of a rocket: moving up. But this code has not actually created a rocket yet. Here is how you actually make a rocket:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_rocket = Rocket()\n",
    "print(my_rocket)\n",
    "```\n",
    "```<__main__.Rocket object at 0x7f6f50c39190>```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see that the variable `my_rocket` is a Rocket object from the `__main__` program file, which is stored at a particular location in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a better representative meaning when printing an object and to do so, you should re-implement `__str__` for string representation  and `__rep__` for Reproducible  representation as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Rocket():\n",
    "    # Rocket simulates a rocket ship for a game,\n",
    "    #  or a physics simulation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    #....\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def __str__(self):\n",
    "        return f\"A Rocket positioned at ({self.x},{self.y})\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def __repr__(self):\n",
    "        return f\"Rocket({self.x},{self.y})\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To test the representation functions, just do this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(my_rocket)\n",
    "my_rocket\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have a class, you can define an object and use its methods. Here is how you might define a rocket and have it start to move up:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"Rocket altitude:\", my_rocket.y)\n",
    "\n",
    "my_rocket.move_up()\n",
    "print(\"Rocket altitude:\", my_rocket.y)\n",

    "#### About Inheritance\n",
    "One of the most important goals of the object-oriented approach to programming is the creation of stable, reliable, reusable code. If you had to create a new class for every kind of object you wanted to model, you would hardly have any reusable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python and any other language that supports OOP, one class can inherit from another class. This means you can base a new class on an existing class; the new class inherits all of the attributes and behavior of the class it is based on.\n",
    "\n",
    "A new class can override any undesirable attributes or behavior of the class it inherits from, and it can add any new attributes or behavior that are appropriate. The original class is called the parent class, and the new class is a child of the parent class. The parent class is also called a superclass, and the child class is also called a subclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want now to model a space shuttle which is a special kind of rocket. The shuttle class inherit all of the attributes and behavior of a Rocket, and then add a few appropriate attributes and behavior for a Shuttle.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what the Shuttle class looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Shuttle(Rocket):\n",
    "    # Shuttle simulates a space shuttle, which is really\n",
    "    #  just a reusable rocket.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def __init__(self, x=0, y=0, flights_completed=0):\n",
    "        super().__init__(x, y)\n",
    "        self.flights_completed = flights_completed\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__init__()` function of the new class needs to call the `__init__()` function of the parent class. The `__init__()` function of the new class needs to accept all of the parameters required to build an object from the parent class, and these parameters need to be passed to the __init__() function of the parent class. The `super().__init__()` function takes care of that.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenge 2\n",
    "1. Test the new class\n",
    "2. Create 10  Rockets and 10 shuttles with random positions and random flights_completed. You may use the `randint` built-in function from the `random` module.\n",
    "3. Print the position with the distances among all shuttles and Rockets."

    "Most of the functionality in Python is provided by modules. The Python Standard Library is a large collection of modules that provides cross-platform implementations of common facilities such as access to the operating system, file I/O, string management, network communication, and much more.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "To use a module in a Python program it first has to be imported. A module can be imported using the import statement. For example, to import the module math, which contains many standard mathematical functions, we can do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import math\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This includes the whole module and makes it available for use later in the program. For example, we can do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import math\n",
    "\n",
    "x = math.cos(2 * math.pi)\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Alternatively, we can chose to import all symbols (functions and variables) in a module to the current namespace (so that we don't need to use the prefix \"math.\" every time we use something from the math module:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from math import *\n",
    "\n",
    "x = cos(2 * pi)\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This pattern can be very convenient, but in large programs that include many modules it is often a good idea to keep the symbols from each module in their own namespaces, by using the import math pattern. This would elminate potentially confusing problems with name space collisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a third alternative, we can chose to import only a few selected symbols from a module by explicitly listing which ones we want to import instead of using the wildcard character *:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from math import cos, pi\n",
    "\n",
    "x = cos(2 * pi)\n",
    "print(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at what a module contains, and its documentation\n",
    "Once a module is imported, we can list the symbols it provides using the dir function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import math\n",
    "print(dir(math))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "A `package` is a `module`, except it can have other modules (and indeed other packages) inside it.\n",
    "A package is a directory with a `__init__.py` file and any number of python files or other package directories. \n",

    "A well structured, standard layout (See Figure) for creating a package will help you build, install and distribute it.\n",

    "\n",
    "We want to create a package that contains the module, `rocket`, we created previously. To do So, follow the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new folder and name it `rocket`.\n",
    "2. In the `rocket` folder:\n",
    "    *  Create a subfolder `rocket`.\n",
    "        *  Copy and past the `rocket.py` file.\n",
    "        *  Create a  `__init__.py` file.\n",
    "            * in the init file just `import rocket` and save the file.\n",
    "        \n",
    "    *  create a `LICENSE.txt` file. You may Copy and Past the MIT License Content available in https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/ to create a `LICENSE.txt`.\n",
    "    *  Create a `README.md` file. You may Copy and modify the `README.md` file existed in the jupyther notebook folder\n",
    "    *  Create a `setup.py` file. Use the `setup.py` file  existed in the jupyther notebook folder as a template.\n",
    "3. Build a source distribution (sdist) ⇒ a tar archive of all the files needed to build and install the package. To do So open a terminal window and navigate to your package folder. Then, lauch command: `python setup.py sdist`.\n",
    "    * To install the package simply, run `pip install dist/<file-tar-name.tar.gz>`\n",
    "4. Alternatively, you can build wheels (bdist_wheel) ⇒ a binary distribution .whl file directly installable through the pip install command. To do so tape the following command in a terminal window: `python setup.py bdist_wheel`\n",
    "    * To install the package simply, run this time `pip install dist/<file-wheel-name.whl>`\n",
    "5.  Online deployment:\n",
    "    * to upload your packgage to pypi.org you have to first register an account: https://pypi.org/account/register/.\n",
    "    * Install the twin package ==> `conda install  twine`\n",
    "    * Tape the commande `twine upload dist/*` and provide your credential to upload your package to pypi\n",
    "    * Now, you can install your package from online by simply typing: `pip install <package-name>`\n",
